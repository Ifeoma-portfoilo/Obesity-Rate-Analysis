# Obesity Rate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the obesity rates across U.S States using Excel. The goal was to practice data cleaning, analysis and dashboard creation skills while communicating insights visually.

## Objectives
- Identify states with highest and lowest obesity rates.
- Calculate average obesity rate across all States.
- Visualize obesity distribution using KPIs and charts.
- Compare obesity with land are to find density patterns.
- Build an interactive and storytelling Excel dashboard.

## Key Insights
- Obesity is not evenly spread across the U.S.
- States like Mississippi and West Virigina recorded as the highest rates (above 35%).
- Land size doesn't directly explain obesity patterns.
- Smaller states can have higher obesity density per land area.
- Some regions may require targeted health interventions.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Formulas: MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, and INDEX-MATCH.

## What I Learnt
- How to structure and visualize Excel data effectively.
- How to calculate and display KPIs.
- How to communicate insights through clear storytelling and layout designs.
